## Round 1

<ENVIRONMENT>
I have no music production experience, but I am a skilled computer scientist who can do anything in pretty much any programming language. I am running NixOS 25.11, and I have access to good compute through my desktop I can ssh into. The dsektop is has an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D 16 core CPU and a NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.

My laptop is running NixOS as well, on an AMD Ryzen 5900HS 8 core CPU and an NVIDIA 3060 GPU, but I have to explicitly activate the discrete GPU (dGPU), and most of the time it is off, and I'm using the integrated graphics (iGPU) instead of the Ryzen Vega chip instead.
</ENVIRONMENT>

<CONTEXT>
I want to create audio samples for use in a game, and I am using Godot Engine. Based on the docs, I think that an MP3 file format would be best. So I would like an open-source, free, and easy-to-use audio recording and sampling software to create sound effects for the game, that can output to MP3 file format.

<RESOURCES>
Godot Engine docs about importing audio samples can be found here:

## Round 2

Okay, you're on the right track with tone and brevity. This is good advice, thank you.

I should also clarify that I am using Nix Flakes, and the Determinate Nix (3.6.2), which is compatible with nix 2.29.0. Please use the API of the newer experimental nix-command flakes when outputting instructions for NixOS.
