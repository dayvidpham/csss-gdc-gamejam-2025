## Round 1

<ENVIRONMENT>
I have no music production experience, but I am a skilled computer scientist who can do anything in pretty much any programming language. I am running NixOS 25.11, and I have access to good compute through my desktop I can ssh into. The dsektop is has an AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D 16 core CPU and a NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.

My laptop is running NixOS as well, on an AMD Ryzen 5900HS 8 core CPU and an NVIDIA 3060 GPU, but I have to explicitly activate the discrete GPU (dGPU), and most of the time it is off, and I'm using the integrated graphics (iGPU) instead of the Ryzen Vega chip instead.
</ENVIRONMENT>

<CONTEXT>
I want to create audio samples for use in a game, and I am using Godot Engine. Based on the docs, I think that an MP3 file format would be best. So I would like an open-source, free, and easy-to-use audio recording and sampling software to create sound effects for the game, that can output to MP3 file format.
</CONTEXT>

<RESOURCES>
Godot Engine docs about importing audio samples can be found here:

## Round 2

Okay, you're on the right track with tone and brevity. This is good advice, thank you.

I should also clarify that I am using Nix Flakes, and the Determinate Nix (3.6.2), which is compatible with nix 2.29.0. Please use the API of the newer experimental nix-command flakes when outputting instructions for NixOS.


## Round 3

This is my current environment setup. Ignore the top-level description, it's just a placeholder.

```nix
{
    description = "Base configuration using flake to manage NixOS";

    # Inputs
    # https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html#flake-inputs
    inputs = {
        #############################
        # NixOS-related inputs
        nixpkgs.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
        nixpkgs-unstable.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
        nixpkgs-stable.url = "github:NixOS/nixpkgs/nixos-25.05";

    };

    outputs =
        inputs@{ self
        # NixOS-related
        , nixpkgs
        , nixpkgs-unstable
        , nixpkgs-stable
        , ...
        }:
        let
            system = "x86_64-linux";
            nixpkgs-options = {
                inherit system;

                config = {
                    allowUnfree = true;
                    cudaSupport = true;
                };
            };

            pkgs = import nixpkgs nixpkgs-options;
            pkgs-unstable = import nixpkgs-unstable nixpkgs-options;
            pkgs-stable = import nixpkgs-stable nixpkgs-options;

            lib = pkgs.lib;

        in
            {
            devShells.${system}.default = pkgs.mkShell {
                packages = [
                    pkgs.audacity
                ];
            };
        };
}
```


## Round 4

<INSTRUCTION>
Let's ignore installing things system-wide for now, unless necessary.
</INSTRUCTION>
<TASK>
I think my Samsung S23 android phone has a better mic than my ASUS Flow X13 laptop.
I don't want to pull any sound effects from the Internet. I want to produce them myself, as a Foley artist would.

I think I want to use my phone for recording live samples, then moving them to my laptop and processing them there.

Is there any particular recording application I should use?
</TASK>


## Round 5

Okay, I've recorded a few tracks now. I want to extract individual samples out of each track, saving them each to a single file. How can I do this in Audacity?
